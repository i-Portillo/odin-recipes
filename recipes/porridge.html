    <img src="https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/df4251a9225ba632/1200x630cq70/photo.jpg">

    <p>Basic recipe for a basic meal. Vikings were basic, what did you expect?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3-4 dl coarse barley flour</li>
      <li>1 litre water</li>
      <li>2 apples and maybe a handful of hazelnuts</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the water.</li>
      <li>Once the water boils, whisk down the flour a little at a time.</li>
      <li>Continue boiling for 5 minutes while continuously stirring.</li>
      <li>The apples and chopped nuts are boiled the last minutes.</li>
      <li>Take the pot off the fire and place it close to the fire for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>A bit of honey or butter on top of the porridge adds taste. The apples can be replaced or complemented with the fruits and berries of the season.</p>
    <p>The water can partially or entirely be replaced with milk, but then the porridge burns more easily. If you have made butter the butter milk from that can be used.</p>
